# Description
The **R Bootcamp** (also known as “Data Wrangling in R”) provides an overview of the fundamental concepts necessary to work within the R statistical programming language. Through a series of annotated, hands-on lessons that include practice exercises, students will learn to understand the basic principles of the R language including: 1) working with operators and objects; 2) understanding different data structures (e.g., vectors, factors, and data frames) and data types (e.g., numeric, character, logical); 3) using functions and packages; 4) reading, writing and manipulating data; and 5) basic and intermediate plotting. No prior programming experience is necessary to benefit from this course.
